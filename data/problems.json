E[X] = sum from i=1 to 6 of i*P(first blue on draw i). P(first blue on draw 1) = 3/8. P(first blue on draw 2) = (5/8)*(3/7) = 15/56. Continuing: E[X] = 1*(3/8) + 2*(5/8)*(3/7) + 3*(5/8)*(4/7)*(3/6) + 4*(5/8)*(4/7)*(3/6)*(3/5) + 5*(5/8)*(4/7)*(3/6)*(2/5)*(3/4) + 6*(5/8)*(4/7)*(3/6)*(2/5)*(1/4)*(3/3) = 3/8 + 30/56 + 60/112 + 60/112 + 30/56 + 6/8 = 1.5"
